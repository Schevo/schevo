        The faster implementation of this class is in _persistent.c.
        The __slots__ and methods of this class are the ones that typical
        applications use very frequently, so we want them to be fast.

        Instance attributes:
          _p_status: UNSAVED | SAVED | GHOST
            UNSAVED means that state that is here, self.__dict__, is usable and
              has not been stored.
            SAVED means that the state that is here, self.__dict__, is usable
              and the same as the stored state.
            GHOST means that the state that is here, self.__dict__, is empty
              and unusable until it is updated from storage.

            New instances are UNSAVED.
            UNSAVED -> SAVED
              happens when the instance state, self.__dict__, is saved.
            UNSAVED -> GHOST
              happens on an abort (if the object has previously been saved).
            SAVED   -> UNSAVED
              happens when changes are made to self.__dict__.
            SAVED   -> GHOST
              happens when the cache manager wants space.
            GHOST   -> SAVED
              happens when the instance state is loaded from the storage.
            GHOST   -> UNSAVED
              this happens when you want to make changes to self.__dict__.
              The stored state is loaded during this state transition.
            
          _p_touched: 0 | 1
            _p_touched is set to 1 on every access to an attribute in
            self.__dict__.  This allows the cache manager to identify SAVED
            instances that have not been recently used.
