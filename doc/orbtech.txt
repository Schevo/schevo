*Overview*

Orbtech is a small company owned by Patrick K. O'Brian, who has over 20 years experience in the development of database applications.

We are specialized on the production of domain-specific proprietary database applications for selected customers, which need more advanced solutions than a conventional database can provide.

Most notably is the implementation of xxx for xxx used by xxx.

To serve this and other customers needs, we have implemented the "Schevo Database System", which we use in our daily development work.


*Open Source*

We have made Schevo available as Open Source under the LGPL license. This allows you to embed Schevo in your applications, _without_ the need to open the sources or your application.

We use python, a dynamic programming language used by NASA, Google and thousands of other companies and individuals worldwide.

Other open source products, which we use in our daily work are:

Louie     - 
PyCrust   - 
pyPersyst - a simplified storage system
