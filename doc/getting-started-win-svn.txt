Checkout and install Schevo using Subversion
============================================

This installation is suitable for power users and Schevo core
developers who must stay up-to-date with the very latest Schevo
revisions.

1. Using Windows Explorer, navigate to the directory that you will use
   to store your Schevo code.  For example, ``C:\code`` is a typically
   used directory.

2. Right-click in the directory and choose `SVN Checkout`.

3. In the `Checkout` dialog that appears, enter the following values:

   * **URL of repository:** ``svn://svn.orbtech.com/schevo/trunk``

   * **Checkout directory:** A directory underneath the directory that
     you navigated to in step 1.  For example, ``C:\code\schevo`` is a
     typically used directory.

4. Click `OK`.  A dialog will appear presenting progress information
   about the checkout process.

5. When the checkout finishes, click `Start`, `Run...`, and enter
   `cmd` to start a command prompt.

6. At the command prompt, change to the directory in which you checked
   out the Schevo code.  For the example paths given above, you would
   type::

     c:
     cd \code\schevo

7. Enter the following command to install Schevo, along with the
   dependencies used by Schevo's auxiliary packages::

     python ez_setup.py .

   Note: The period at the end is important, as it tells `ez_setup` to
   install the software in the current directory.

8. Enter the following command to cause your Schevo checkout to be the
   location from which Schevo packages are imported::

     python setup.py develop


Install `TortoiseSVN`
=====================

**Recommended** for **Subversion** installs.

If you have a Subversion client you are already familiar with, skip to
the next section, using that client as needed.

If you do not have a Subversion client, TortoiseSVN is an excellent
tool for managing Subversion checkouts.

1. Visit the `TortoiseSVN download page
   <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=138498&package_id=151948>`__
   and download the most recent installer.

2. Open the file you downloaded in step 1 to start the installation
   process.

3. Step through the installer, keeping all values at their defaults.
