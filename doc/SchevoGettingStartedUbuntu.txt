==========================================
 Getting Started with Schevo Using Ubuntu
==========================================


Below, we describe in detail how to install Schevo for Ubuntu Linux
and other Debian-based Linux distributions. The instructions have been
tested on the following operating systems:

* Ubuntu Linux 6.10

* Ubuntu Linux 7.04 prerelease

Users of other UNIX-derived or UNIX-like operating systems not listed
above can use this document as a guideline.

Mac users, see `SchevoGettingStartedMacOsx`:trac:.


Install Python packages
=======================

Run the following in a terminal to install the required Python
packages and compiler tools::

    $ sudo aptitude install build-essential python2.4-dev

If you want to work with Python 2.5, and your distribution includes it
(modern Ubuntu distributions do), replace ``python2.4-dev`` above with
``python2.5-dev``.

If you do not have administrator privileges, request to have them
installed (or the equivalents on the operating system you are using).


Download workingenv and set up an environment for Schevo
========================================================

1. Download `workingenv.py
   <http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/workingenv/workingenv.py>`__
   to your home directory.

2. If it doesn't exist, create a directory named ``env`` in your home
   directory using a terminal or your favorite file manager.

3. In a terminal, create the environment::

    $ python ~/workingenv.py ~/env/schevo


Activate the Schevo environment
===============================

In a terminal, run these commands to activate the Schevo environment
and change to its source directory::

    $ source ~/env/schevo/bin/activate
    $ cd ~/env/schevo/src

You'll see ``(schevo)`` added to your prompt.  Repeat this section
every time you want to access the ``schevo`` working environment.


Installing Schevo
=================

In a command prompt, use *EasyInstall* to install the latest release
of Schevo::

    easy_install Schevo
