Abstract
========

This document describes in detail how to install Schevo for the
following operating systems:

* Ubuntu Linux 5.10

Users of other UNIX-derived or UNIX-like operating systems not listed
above can use this document as a guideline.


Installing Schevo
=================


Ubuntu Linux 5.10 (Breezy Badger)
---------------------------------

This section steps you through installing Schevo with the assumption
that you have installed all of the following prerequisite software:

* Python 2.4 or higher

* Python 2.4-compatible C compiler

* `Qt` and `PyQt` (recommended but not required)

* `wxPython` (optional)

* `Subversion` (recommended if you follow Schevo's Subversion
  repository)

You can install all of these prerequisites with the following command
entered into a terminal window (all as one line)::

  sudo apt-get install pyqt-tools python2.4-qt3 python2.4-dev
      gcc g++ python-wxgtk2.6 subversion


Install Schevo using `Easy install`
...................................

This installation is suitable for casual users who want to get up and
running as quickly as possible, and consists of one step if you have
`Easy Install`_.

.. _Easy Install: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

1. At a command prompt, run the following command (all as one line)::

     sudo easy_install -f http://schevo.org/dist 
         --script-dir /usr/local/bin Schevo 

If you do not yet have Easy Install on your system, see below to use
the two-step `ez_setup` process.


Installation with `ez_setup`
____________________________

1. Download the `ez_setup.py`_ script.

.. _ez_setup.py: http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py

2. At a command prompt, change to the directory that you downloaded
   `ez_setup.py` into and run the following commands.  The first will
   install or update setuptools; the second will install Schevo::

     sudo python ez_setup.py

     sudo easy_install -f http://schevo.org/dist 
         --script-dir /usr/local/bin Schevo 

     sudo easy_install -f http://schevo.org/split.html \ 
         --script-dir /usr/local/bin \
       Schevo==dev SchevoQt==dev SchevoXml==dev SchevoSql==dev


Checkout and install Schevo using Subversion
............................................

This installation is suitable for power users and Schevo core
developers who must stay up-to-date with the very latest Schevo
revisions.

1. In a terminal window, change to the directory that you will use to
   store your Schevo code.  For example, ``~/code`` is a typically
   used directory.

2. Run the following command to check out the trunk of the Schevo
   Subversion repository to the ``~/code/schevo`` directory::

     svn co svn://orbtech.com/schevo/Schevo/trunk Schevo
     svn co svn://orbtech.com/schevo/SchevoQt/trunk SchevoQt

3. Change to the directory in which you checked out the Schevo code.
   For the example paths given above, you would type::

     cd ~/code/schevo

4. Enter the following command to install Schevo, along with the
   dependencies used by Schevo's auxiliary packages::

     sudo python ez_setup.py --script-dir /usr/local/bin .

   Note: The period at the end is important, as it tells `ez_setup` to
   install the software in the current directory.

5. Enter the following command to cause your Schevo checkout to be the
   location from which Schevo packages are imported::

     sudo python setup.py develop


What to do after Schevo is installed
====================================

Once you've installed Schevo, you can test Schevo using an example
database as described below, and/or take a brief tour of Schevo
features by following the examples given in `A Brief Exploration of a
Schevo Database <exploration.html>`__.


Test Schevo using an example database schema
--------------------------------------------

**Recommended** for **all** installs.

1. Open a shell / command prompt.

   * Microsoft Windows: Click `Start`, `Run...`, and enter `cmd` to
     start a command prompt.

2. Enter the following command to create a new database using an
   example schema and icon set::

     evo db create --app=schevo.example.todo todo.db

3. Enter the following command to browse the resulting database::

     evo nav todo.db

   A window should appear titled `Navigator :: todo.db`, containing
   a three-paned database navigator.
