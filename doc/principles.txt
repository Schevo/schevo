The Schevo `schema definition syntax <reference-schema.html>`__ and
`public API <reference-api.html>`__ were designed very carefully, with
these goals in mind:

* Provide deep introspection allowing rich auto-generated user
  interfaces.

* Convenient use in a Python shell -- help the user while staying out
  of their way.

* Name and call-signature symmetry and consistency.

* Straightforward and consistent extension of default behavior.

* Encourage composition of smaller pieces into larger ones.

* Readability.

* Prefer declarative over imperative.

* Take full advantage of the core Python language.

* Data consistency assurance.

* Namespace collision avoidance.

* Reduction of boilerplate code.

* Reduction of reserved words.

* Separate layers of functionality, but keep related layers nearby in
  the source code.
