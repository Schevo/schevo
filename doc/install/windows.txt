 Install Schevo on Microsoft Windows 
=====================================


Below, we describe in detail how to install Schevo for Microsoft
Windows.  The instructions have been tested on the following operating
systems:

* Microsoft Windows XP SP2 or higher.


Install Python
==============

1. Download the Windows installer for Python 2.5 by visiting the
   `2.5.1 release page
   <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.1/>`__ and downloading
   the ``python-2.5.1.msi`` file.

2. Open the ``msi`` file to start the installation process.

3. Step through the Python installer, accepting the default values for
   each step.

4. Add the following directories to your `PATH` environment variable
   (see `Setting Environment Variables`_ below):

   * ``c:\python25``

   * ``c:\python25\scripts``

5. Test your Python installation by clicking *Start*, *Run...*, and
   entering ``cmd`` to start a command prompt. When the command prompt
   window appears, enter ``python``. You should the be greeted with
   the Python interactive shell, which will look similar to this::

     Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Apr 18 2007, 08:51:08) ...
     Type "help", "copyright", "credits", or "license" ...
     >>>

   To exit the Python shell, press Ctrl-Z and press Enter.


Install `pywin32` extensions
============================

1. Visit the `pywin32 download page
   <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78018&package_id=79063>`__
   and download the most recent package that ends with ``py2.5.exe``.
   For example, at the time of this writing that file would be
   ``pywin32-210.win32-py2.5.exe``.

2. Open the file you downloaded in step 1 to start the installation
   process.

3. Step through the installer, accepting default values for each step.

4. At the end of the installer, check the install log to see if it
   contains this message at the bottom of the log::

     ******************** WARNING ********************
     It appears that the MFC DLL 'mfc71.dll' is not installed
     Pythonwin will not work without this DLL, and I haven't had the
     time to package it in with the installer.

     You can download this DLL from:
     http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/
     **************************************************

   If you see that message, browse to the `URL it mentions
   <http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/>`__ and follow the
   instructions under the `MFC DLLs for Pythonwin` heading for
   downloading and installing the ``mfc71.dll`` file.


Download Easy Install and virtualenv and set up an environment for Schevo
=========================================================================

1. Install `Easy Install
   <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installing-easy-install>`__
   per the instructions at that link.

2. Install `virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`__ by
   running this at a command prompt::

     easy_install virtualenv

3. In a command prompt, create the environment::

     virtualenv c:\env\schevo


Activate the Schevo environment
===============================

In a command prompt, run this command to activate the Schevo
environment and change to its source directory::

    c:\env\schevo\scripts\activate

You'll see ``(schevo)`` added to your prompt.  Repeat this section
every time you want to access the ``schevo`` working environment.


Installing Schevo
=================

In a command prompt, use *EasyInstall* to install the latest release
of Schevo::

    easy_install Schevo


What to do after Schevo is installed
====================================

Take a tour by choosing one of the `Schevo tutorials <../tutorial/>`__.


Setting Environment Variables
=============================

When following the instructions below, you will often be asked to set
environment variables.

This is how you do so using Microsoft XP:

1. Click Start, then right-click your `My Computer` icon.

2. Choose `Properties`.

3. Click the `Advanced` tab.

4. Click the `Environment Variables` button.

5. Alter environment variables as needed in the `User variables`
   section.

   * To create a new variable, click the `New` button, enter the name
     and value of the variable, then click `OK`.

   * To edit an existing variable, click on it, click the `Edit`
     button, alter the name and/or value of the variable, then click
     `OK`.

   * If a variable contains paths, each path must be separated by a
     semicolon ";" character.

   * If you are creating the `PATH` variable for the first time, be
     sure to place the special value ``%PATH%`` as the first value.
     For instance, if adding the ``c:\python24`` directory to a
     newly-created `PATH` variable, enter ``%PATH%;c:\python24`` as
     the value.

6. Click `OK`.

7. Click `OK`.
