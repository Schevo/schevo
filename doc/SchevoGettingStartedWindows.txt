===========================================
 Getting Started with Schevo using Windows
===========================================


Below, we describe in detail how to install Schevo for Microsoft
Windows.  The instructions have been tested on the following operating
systems:

* Microsoft Windows XP SP2 or higher.


Install Python 2.4 or Python 2.5
================================

1. Download the Windows installer for the version of Python you desire.

    a. For Python 2.4, visit the `2.4.4 release page
       <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4.4/>`__ and
       download the ``python-2.4.4.msi`` file.
    
    b. For Python 2.5, visit the `2.5 release page
       <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/>`__ and download
       the ``python-2.5.msi`` file.

2. Open the file you downloaded in step 1 to start the installation
   process.

3. Step through the Python installer, accepting the default values for
   each step.

4. Add the following directories to your `PATH` environment variable
   (see `Setting Environment Variables`_ below):

   * ``c:\python24`` (or ``c:\python25`` if you installed Python 2.5)

   * ``c:\python24\scripts`` (or ``c:\python25\scripts``)

5. Test your Python installation by clicking *Start*, *Run...*, and
   entering ``cmd`` to start a command prompt. When the command prompt
   window appears, enter ``python``. You should the be greeted with
   the Python interactive shell, which will look similar to this::

     Python 2.4.4 (#71, Oct 18 2006, 08:34:43) ...
     Type "help", "copyright", "credits", or "license" ...
     >>> 

   To exit the Python shell, press Ctrl-Z and press Enter.


Install `pywin32` extensions
============================

1. Visit the `pywin32 download page
   <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78018>`__
   and download the most recent package that ends with ``py2.4.exe``
   (or the one that ends with ``py2.5.exe`` if you are using Python
   2.5).  For example, at the time of this writing that file would be
   ``pywin32-210.win32-py2.4.exe``.

2. Open the file you downloaded in step 1 to start the installation
   process.

3. Step through the installer, accepting default values for each step.


Install `MinGW` compiler
========================

**Not required** unless you are working on the code for Schevo itself.

This section is optional for those who already have a compiler
installed on their computer that is supported by Python 2.4.

If you do not fall under that category, you must install MinGW in
order for Schevo to build C extensions.

1. Visit the `MinGW download page
   <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435>`__ and
   download the latest ``MinGW-#.#.#.exe`` file that appears
   underneath the *Current* section.  For example, at the time of this
   writing that file would be ``MinGW-5.1.3.exe``.

2. Open the file you downloaded in step 1 to start the installation
   process.

3. Step through the installer, keeping all values at their defaults.
   When you get to the **Select Components** page, do the following:

   * Choose `Custom` type of installation.

   * Place a check next to these required components.

     * MinGW base tools
     
     * g++ compiler
     
     * MinGW Make
     
4. Add the following directory to your `PATH` environment variable
   (see `Setting Environment Variables`_ below):

   * ``c:\mingw\bin``

5. Create or edit the ``c:\python24\lib\distutils\distutils.cfg`` (or
   ``c:\python25\lib\distutils\distutils.cfg`` file) using Notepad or
   your favorite text editor.  Add the following to the file and save
   it::

     [build]
     compiler=mingw32


Download workingenv and set up an environment for Schevo
========================================================

1. Download `workingenv.py
   <http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/workingenv/workingenv.py>`__
   to ``c:\python24\scripts`` (or ``c:\python25\scripts``).

2. If it doesn't exist, create a ``c:\env`` folder using Windows
   Explorer or a command prompt.

3. In a command prompt, create the environment::

    python c:\python24\scripts\workingenv.py --site-packages c:\env\schevo


Activate the Schevo environment
===============================

In a command prompt, run these commands to activate the Schevo
environment and change to its source directory::

    c:\env\schevo\bin\activate.bat
    c:
    cd \env\schevo\src

You'll see ``(schevo)`` added to your prompt.  Repeat this section
every time you want to access the ``schevo`` working environment.


Installing Schevo
=================

In a command prompt, use *EasyInstall* to install the latest release
of Schevo::

    easy_install Schevo
    

What to do after Schevo is installed
====================================

Take a tour by choosing one of the `SchevoTutorials`:trac:.


Setting Environment Variables
=============================

When following the instructions below, you will often be asked to set
environment variables.

This is how you do so using Microsoft XP:

1. Right-click your `My Computer` icon.

2. Choose `Properties`.

3. Click the `Advanced` tab.

4. Click the `Environment Variables` button.

5. Alter environment variables as needed in the `User variables`
   section.

   * To create a new variable, click the `New` button, enter the name
     and value of the variable, then click `OK`.

   * To edit an existing variable, click on it, click the `Edit`
     button, alter the name and/or value of the variable, then click
     `OK`.

   * If a variable contains paths, each path must be separated by a
     semicolon ";" character.

   * If you are creating the `PATH` variable for the first time, be
     sure to place the special value ``%PATH%`` as the first value.
     For instance, if adding the ``c:\python24`` directory to a
     newly-created `PATH` variable, enter ``%PATH%;c:\python24`` as
     the value.

6. Click `OK`.

7. Click `OK`.
