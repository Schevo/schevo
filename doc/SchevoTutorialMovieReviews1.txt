 Schevo Tutorial: Movie Reviews
================================

In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a skeleton Schevo application
and a simple database schema. As you update the schema, we will show you how
to explore the database using the Python interpreter.  Here is what the
final schema will look like:

.. code-block:: python

    """Schema for MovieReviews."""

    from schevo.schema import *
    schevo.schema.prep(locals())


    class SchevoIcon(E.Entity):

        _hidden = True

        name = f.unicode()
        data = f.image()

        _key(name)


    class Actor(E.Entity):

        name = f.unicode()
    
        _key(name)

        def x_movies(self):
            return [casting.movie 
                    for casting in self.m.movie_castings()]


    class Director(E.Entity):

        name = f.unicode()
    
        _key(name)


    class Movie(E.Entity):

        title = f.unicode()
        description = f.memo()
        release_date = f.date()
        director = f.entity('Director')

        _key(title)

        def x_actors(self):
            return [casting.actor 
                    for casting in self.m.movie_castings()]

        def __unicode__(self):
            return u'%s (%i)' % (self.title, self.release_date.year)


    class MovieCasting(E.Entity):

        movie = f.entity('Movie', CASCADE)
        actor = f.entity('Actor')

        _key(movie, actor)

If you have not done so already, set up a Schevo environment as described in
`SchevoGettingStarted`:trac:.

This tutorial is also a doctest, so let us set up doctest environment::

    >>> from schevo.test import DocTest


Create a Schevo application
===========================

At a shell prompt, use the ``paster`` tool to create a new Schevo
application::

    $ paster create --template=schevo MovieReviews  # [1]
    $ cd moviereviews                               # [2]
    $ python setup.py develop                       # [3]

1. Create a new Schevo application called "MovieReviews". A directory called
``moviereviews`` will be created with the new application inside.

2. Change into the ``moviereviews`` directory.

3. Install it into your Python environment in development mode.


The default database schema
***************************

In your favorite text editor, open the file
``moviereviews/schema/schema_001.py``. This is the filename convention that
Schevo uses when creating and evolving databases. The ``001`` represents the
version number of the schema.


Namespace preparation
*********************

In the schema you will see the following lines near the top. These prepare the
module namespace with the necessary "ingredients" for the Schevo schema
syntax::

    >>> schema = '''
    ...     from schevo.schema import *     # [1]
    ...     schevo.schema.prep(locals())    # [2]
    ...     '''

1. The developers of Schevo tend to eschew the careless use of ``import *``,
but this one is rather useful.  It imports only about 13 variables, carefully
named to avoid namespace clashes with the database schema.

2. Prepare the module's namespace for building and storing the structure of
the database schema about to be declared.


Icon storage
************

The default schema also has a class called ``SchevoIcon``. We're not going to
take advantage of this in this tutorial, but let's explore this class a little
bit as it will give us a template for the other classes you'll add to your
schema::

    >>> schema += '''
    ...     class SchevoIcon(E.Entity):     # [1]
    ...         """Stores icons for Schevo database and application objects."""
    ... 
    ...         _hidden = True              # [2]
    ...     
    ...         name = f.unicode()          # [3]
    ...         data = f.image()            # [4]
    ... 
    ...         _key(name)                  # [5]
    ...     '''


1. ``SchevoIcon`` is an *entity class*. All entity classes subclass from
``E.Entity``. See `SchevoNamespaces`:trac: to find out more about the 
``E`` namespace.

2. When the database is open, the ``SchevoIcon`` *extent* that is based on
this class will be designated as hidden. A user interface *may* honor this and
hide this extent from the user in some way.

3. ``name`` is a Unicode string *field*. See `SchevoNamespaces`:trac: to read
more about the ``f`` namespace.

4. ``data`` is an Image field.

5. ``(name)`` is a key for the ``SchevoIcon`` extent. Schevo will not allow
more than one *entity* with the same value in the ``name`` field in this
extent.


Some terminology
================

We've introduced some terms that are not necessarily unique to Schevo, but may
not be familiar for those accustomed to working with SQL. Here are some basic
definitions of those terms. We've left out some details to keep this tutorial
simple.

For more detail, visit the `SchevoGlossary`:trac:.

Entity class
    A class definition in a schema that describes the fields, transactions,
    and other characteristics that each entity of that type will have.

Extent
    A collection object based on an entity class containing same-typed
    entities in a database. Analogous to a table in a SQL database.

Entity
    An object that represents a single item in the database. Analogous to a
    row in a SQL database.

Field
    An object that represents a property of an entity. Analogous to a column
    in a SQL database.


Add an entity class for movies
==============================

Add the following class to the database schema::

    >>> schema += '''
    ...     class Movie(E.Entity):
    ... 
    ...         title = f.unicode()
    ...         release_date = f.date()
    ...         description = f.memo(required=False)    # [1], [2]
    ... 
    ...         _key(title)                             # [3]
    ...     '''


1. ``memo`` fields are a subclass of ``Unicode`` fields; the fact that
``description`` is a ``Memo`` field is a hint that a user interface *may*
use to render a multi-line input widget rather than a single-line one.

2. By default, all fields are required. ``description`` isn't.

3. ``(title)`` is a key for this extent. There can be no two movies with the
same title. This is a bit unrealistic, and indeed Schevo allows you to specify
keys such as ``(title, release_date)``, but we've simplified things for this
tutorial.


Create a database
=================

Save the ``schema_001.py`` file. At a shell prompt, use the ``schevo`` tool to
create a new database with the application's schema::

    $ schevo db create --app=moviereviews sample.db
    
That's it!

At this point, the ``sample.db`` file contains your new database, including
the database schema itself.

For the doctest, let us create an in-memory database with the current schema::

    >>> t = DocTest(schema)
    >>> db = t.db


Add some movies
===============

The ``schevo`` tool gives you a handy way to work with a database using a
Python interpreter. We recommend installing IPython (just run 
``"easy_install IPython"``) for a very comfortable experience.

At a shell prompt, open the database::

    $ schevo shell sample.db

A variable ``db``, representing the open database, is automatically inserted
into the namespace of the interactive session.


Transactions
************

All changes to a Schevo database are done via *transaction* objects that are
responsible for ensuring that changes made to the database follow the rules
you specify. See `SchevoTransactions`:trac: for further discussion about this
design decision and the benefits you gain from it.

Make a new ``create`` transaction for creating a new ``Movie`` entity. Assign
values to fields, then tell the database to execute the transaction::

    >>> tx = db.Movie.t.create()           # [1], [2], [3]
    >>> tx.title = 'A Scanner Darkley'     # [4]
    >>> tx.release_date = '2006-07-28'     # [5]
    >>> movie = db.execute(tx)             # [6]

1. ``db.Movie`` is the ``Movie`` extent in the database.

2. Extents have a ``t`` namespace that contains *transaction methods*.

3. By calling the ``create`` transaction method, we receive a transaction
object that will attempt to create a new Movie entity upon execution.

4. Set the transaction's fields to the values that you want the new entity to
have.

5. ``date`` fields are smart and will accept ``datetime.date`` objects as well
as ``YYYY-MM-DD`` and ``MM/DD/YYYY`` formatted strings.

6. When the transaction object executes successfully, it returns the ``Movie``
entity that it just created.

Inspecting the field values of the entity shows that the proper information
was stored in the database::

    >>> movie.title
    u'A Scanner Darkley'
    >>> movie.release_date
    datetime.date(2006, 7, 28)

Oops! There's a typo in the title of the movie. 

The ``movie`` entity object has a ``t`` namespace as well. By default, there
are ``update`` and ``delete`` methods in an entity's ``t`` namespace. 

Create an ``update`` transaction object, correct the name, then execute the
transaction and inspect the result::

    >>> tx = movie.t.update()
    >>> tx.title = 'A Scanner Darkly'
    >>> movie = db.execute(tx)
    >>> movie.title
    u'A Scanner Darkly'


Object representations
======================

At this point, you may notice that if you print the ``movie`` object itself,
it gives you a label based off the first *key* you define for the extent::

    >>> print movie
    A Scanner Darkly

Suppose in a user interface we would like to include the year the movie was
released whenever a summary of a movie entity is to be displayed.

Exit the Python session, then edit ``schema_001.py`` again and add the
``__unicode__`` method to the ``Movie`` class::

    >>> schema += '''
    ...     class Movie(E.Entity):
    ... 
    ...         title = f.unicode()
    ...         release_date = f.date()
    ...         description = f.memo(required=False)
    ... 
    ...         _key(title)
    ...
    ...         def __unicode__(self):
    ...             return u'%s (%i)' % (self.title, self.release_date.year)
    ...     '''

At a shell prompt, update the existing database using the new schema, then
open a Python session again::

    $ schevo update --app=moviereviews sample.db
    $ schevo shell sample.db

For the doctest, let us perform the equivalent operation:

    >>> t.update(schema)
    >>> db = t.db

Find the movie, and inspect it::

    >>> movie = db.Movie.findone(title='A Scanner Darkly')   # [1]
    >>> movie                       # [2]
    <Movie entity oid:1 rev:1>
    >>> print movie                 # [3]
    A Scanner Darkly (2006)

1. The ``findone`` method of an extent finds exactly one entity in that extent
whose fields match those passed to the method. If it can't find any, it
returns ``None``. If it finds more than one, it raises a ``FindOneFoundMany``
exception.

2. The ``repr`` representation of the entity gives you the extent name, the
entity object identifier, and the entity revision.

3. The ``unicode`` representation now gives you a more human-friendly view of
things, suitable not only for interactive use but also for user interface
code.

Schevo likes to make things easy for humans to read, so you can go beyond
thinking of it as a "unicode representation" of something, and think of it
instead as a singular or plural *label* of an object. See `ObjectLabels`:trac:
for further discussion about this feature.


Relationships
=============

Schevo has many relational-like capabilities, and it makes it easy to manage
those.

We'll flex this by having our database keep track of the director of each
movie, and the actors that are in each movie. Close your Python session, and
modify the schema to add the ``Actor``, ``Director``, and ``MovieCasting``
classes, and to modify the ``Movie`` class.

Wait! Before we get started, think about how much data we'll have to populate
with those transaction objects. Schevo allows you to change the structure of a
database within the same schema version to some degree to support rapid
development. Wouldn't it also be nice to place some sample data directly in
the schema?

Schevo lets you do that, so take advantage of it when you modify the schema by
assigning ``_sample`` data lists to each entity class::

    >>> schema += '''
    ...     class Actor(E.Entity):
    ... 
    ...         name = f.unicode()
    ... 
    ...         _key(name)
    ... 
    ... 
    ...     class Director(E.Entity):
    ... 
    ...         name = f.unicode()
    ... 
    ...         _key(name)
    ... 
    ... 
    ...     class Movie(E.Entity):
    ... 
    ...         title = f.unicode()
    ...         release_date = f.date()
    ...         director = f.entity('Director')
    ...         description = f.memo(required=False)
    ... 
    ...         _key(title)
    ... 
    ...         def __unicode__(self):
    ...             return u'%s (%i)' % (self.title, self.release_date.year)
    ... 
    ... 
    ...     class MovieCasting(E.Entity):
    ... 
    ...         movie = f.entity('Movie', CASCADE)
    ...         actor = f.entity('Actor')
    ... 
    ...         _key(movie, actor)
    ... 
    ...         def __unicode__(self):
    ...             return u'%s :: %s' (self.movie, self.actor)
    ... 
    ... 
    ...     E.Actor._sample = [
    ...         ('Keanu Reeves', ),
    ...         ('Winona Ryder', ),
    ...         ]
    ... 
    ...     E.Director._sample = [
    ...         ('Richard Linklater', ),
    ...         ('Stephen Herek', ),
    ...         ('Tim Burton', ),
    ...         ]
    ... 
    ...     E.Movie._sample = [
    ...         ('A Scanner Darkly', '2006-07-28', ('Richard Linklater', ), 
    ...             DEFAULT),
    ...         ("Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure", '1989-02-17', 
    ...             ('Stephen Herek', ), DEFAULT),
    ...         ('Edward Scissorhands', '1990-12-14', ('Tim Burton', ), 
    ...             DEFAULT),
    ...         ]
    ... 
    ...     E.MovieCasting._sample = [
    ...         (('A Scanner Darkly', ), ('Keanu Reeves', )),
    ...         (('A Scanner Darkly', ), ('Winona Ryder', )),
    ...         (("Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure", ), ('Keanu Reeves', )),
    ...         (('Edward Scissorhands', ), ('Winona Ryder', )),
    ...         ]
    ...     '''


Following relationships
***********************

Create a new database with sample data, deleting the old one first, then open
the database in a Python session::

    $ schevo db create --app=moviereviews --delete --sample sample.db
    $ schevo shell sample.db
    
For the doctest, let us do the equivalent::

    >>> t.done()
    >>> t = DocTest(schema)
    >>> db = t.db
    >>> db.populate()

Let us look at how we might use the relationships that Schevo has kept for us.
Perhaps in the full implementation of a video store, some code would like to
find all of the movies that Winona Ryder starred in. This information could be
helpful for helping customers and for promotion of new movies.

Here's how you would find those movies::

    >>> actor = db.Actor.findone(name='Winona Ryder')
    >>> castings = actor.m.movie_castings()
    >>> movies = [casting.movie for casting in castings]
    >>> for movie in movies:
    ...     print movie
    A Scanner Darkly (2006)
    Edward Scissorhands (1990)

If we have a specific movie, we can find the actors in it::

    >>> movie = db.Movie.findone(title='A Scanner Darkly')
    >>> castings = movie.m.movie_castings()
    >>> actors = [casting.actor for casting in castings]
    >>> for actor in actors:
    ...     print actor
    Keanu Reeves
    Winona Ryder

If we have a director, we can find the movies that he or she has directed::

    >>> director = db.Director.findone(name='Richard Linklater')
    >>> movies = director.m.movies()
    >>> for movie in movies:
    ...     print movie
    ...
    A Scanner Darkly (2006)


Adding your own API extensions
==============================

Schevo lets you add API extensions within the ``x`` namespace. A separate
namespace is used to prevent clashes between extension methods and field
names.

When following the relationships above, there was some boilerplate when
finding out an actor's movies, or a movie's actors, due to the
``MovieCasting`` extent that ties them together in a many-to-many
relationship.

The developers of Schevo have found that such intermediary extents are more
useful than trying to embody that type of relationship some other way. We have
run into more than one instance where it became useful to add additional
information *about the relationship itself* via extra fields in the
intermediary extent.

You can use extension methods to reduce this sort of boilerplate, while still
retaining the full flexibility of Schevo's relationship model. Add a new
method called ``x_movies`` to the bottom of the ``Actor`` class::

    >>> schema += '''
    ...     class Actor(E.Entity):
    ... 
    ...         name = f.unicode()
    ... 
    ...         _key(name)
    ...
    ...         def x_movies(self):
    ...             return [casting.movie 
    ...                     for casting in self.m.movie_castings()]
    ...     '''

Add a new method to the ``Movie`` class::

    >>> schema += '''
    ...     class Movie(E.Entity):
    ... 
    ...         title = f.unicode()
    ...         release_date = f.date()
    ...         director = f.entity('Director')
    ...         description = f.memo(required=False)
    ... 
    ...         _key(title)
    ... 
    ...         def x_actors(self):
    ...             return [casting.actor 
    ...                     for casting in self.m.movie_castings()]
    ...
    ...         def __unicode__(self):
    ...             return u'%s (%i)' % (self.title, self.release_date.year)
    ...     '''


Close the Python session, update the database so its schema has the new
methods available, then open a Python session::

    $ schevo db update --app=moviereviews sample.db
    $ schevo shell sample.db

For the doctest, do the equivalent::

    >>> t.update(schema)
    >>> db = t.db

The relationships demonstrated above are now much easier to traverse::

    >>> actor = db.Actor.findone(name='Winona Ryder')
    >>> for movie in actor.x.movies():
    ...     print movie
    ...
    A Scanner Darkly (2006)
    Edward Scissorhands (1990)

    >>> movie = db.Movie.findone(title='A Scanner Darkly')
    >>> for actor in movie.x.actors():
    ...     print actor
    ...
    Keanu Reeves
    Winona Ryder

Since there is a one-to-many relationship between directors and movies, the
use of ``director.m.movies()`` stays the same since there is no intermediate
extent used.
