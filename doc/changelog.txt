Schevo 3.0 series
=================


Schevo 3.0-beta2
----------------

(not yet released)

* Numerous bug fixes, increased test coverage, and incremental
  improvements.

* The Qt3 Navigator now has a QTable-based widget for showing entity
  lists.  This widget is ideal for browsing extents that contain
  several thousand entities, as only the entities that will be shown
  on screen are loaded, instead of the entirety of the extent as with
  the QListView-based widget.

  To use this, run the navigator using one of the following::

    evo nav -t filename.db

    evo nav --use-table filename.db

  Current limitations of the QTable-based widget:

  - Rows can only be sorted by OID, or by fields that are the first
    field specified in one or more indexes or keys for that extent.

  - Rows cannot be sorted for the results of filters.

  - Columns are not automatically auto-sized based on the maximum
    length of values for that column, due to the length of time this
    would take for very large extents.


Schevo 3.0-beta1
----------------

* Initial release of Schevo 3.0 series.
