 Getting Started with Schevo Using Mac OSX
===========================================


Below, we describe in detail how to install Schevo for Mac OSX. The
instructions have been tested on the following operating systems:

* Mac OSX 10.4.9 on Intel-chip Based Mac


Install Python packages
=======================

We recommend using the `Universal MacPython packages`_ available at
the `pythonmac.org`_ site.

.. _Universal MacPython packages: http://pythonmac.org/packages/

.. _pythonmac.org: http://pythonmac.org/

.. _Universal MacPython 2.4: http://pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/index.html

1. At the `Universal MacPython 2.4`_ page, download the disk image
   (``dmg``) file for Python. For instance, the file at the time of
   this writing is ``python-2.4.4-macosx2006-10-18.dmg``.

2. Open the disk image.

3. Open the installer (``mpkg``) file from the disk image.

4. Follow the steps to complete installation, using default values at
   each stage.

If you do not have administrator privileges, request to have an
administrator install Python for you.


Download workingenv and set up an environment for Schevo
========================================================

1. Download `workingenv.py
   <http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/workingenv/workingenv.py>`__
   to your home directory.

2. If it doesn't exist, create a directory named ``env`` in your home
   directory using a terminal or your favorite file manager.

3. In a terminal, create the environment::

    $ python ~/workingenv.py ~/env/schevo


Activate the Schevo environment
===============================

In a terminal, run these commands to activate the Schevo environment
and change to its source directory::

    $ source ~/env/schevo/bin/activate

You'll see ``(schevo)`` added to your prompt.  Repeat this section
every time you want to access the ``schevo`` working environment.
