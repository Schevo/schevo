 Getting Started with Schevo Using Mac OSX
===========================================


Below, we describe in detail how to install Schevo for Mac OSX. The
instructions have been tested on the following operating systems:

* Mac OSX 10.4.10 on Intel-chip Based Mac


Notes on running Python
=======================

Unless you change your `PATH` environment variable, do not run Python
by running ``python``, as that will invoke the system-installed
Python, which is version 2.3.5 in OSX 10.4.

Instead, run ``python2.5`` as shown in examples below.


Install Python packages
=======================

1. At the `Python 2.5.1 release page`_, download the disk image
   (``dmg``) file for Python. For instance, the file at the time of
   this writing is ``python-2.5.1-macosx.dmg``.

.. _Python 2.5.1 release page: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.1/

2. Open the disk image.

3. Open the installer (``mpkg``) file from the disk image.

4. Follow the steps to complete installation, using default values at
   each stage.

If you do not have administrator privileges, request to have an
administrator install Python for you.


Download workingenv and set up an environment for Schevo
========================================================

1. Download `workingenv.py
   <http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/workingenv/workingenv.py>`__
   to your home directory.

2. If it doesn't exist, create a directory named ``env`` in your home
   directory using a terminal or your favorite file manager.

3. In a terminal, create the environment::

    $ python2.5 ~/workingenv.py ~/env/schevo


Activate the Schevo environment
===============================

In a terminal, run these commands to activate the Schevo environment
and change to its source directory::

    $ source ~/env/schevo/bin/activate

You'll see ``(schevo)`` added to your prompt.  Repeat this section
every time you want to access the ``schevo`` working environment.


Installing Schevo
=================

In a command prompt, use *EasyInstall* to install the latest release
of Schevo::

    easy_install Schevo


What to do after Schevo is installed
