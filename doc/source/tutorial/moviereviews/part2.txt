In this installment of this tutorial, we will show you how to ...

Here is what the final schema will look like:

.. code-block:: python

    """Schema for MovieReviews."""

    from schevo.schema import *
    schevo.schema.prep(locals())

    ...

If you have not done so already, follow the steps in `Part One <part1.html>`__.

This tutorial is also a doctest, so let us set up doctest
environment::

Where we left off
=================

In the previous installment of this tutorial, we left off with a
schema that provided structures to store movies, where each movie had
one and only one director, and zero or more actors.  We also included
some sample data.

The schema is embodied in an example database schema included with
Schevo. Let us use that as a starting point::

    >>> import schevo.schema
    >>> schema = schevo.schema.read(
    ...     location='schevo.example.moviereviews.schema',
    ...     version=1,
    ...     )
    >>> t = DocTest(schema)
