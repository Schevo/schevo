Notes on running Python
=======================

With Ubuntu 7.04, or any Linux distribution that uses Python 2.5 as
the default Python, so just run ``python`` when invoking Python as per
the directions below.

With Ubuntu 6.10, or any Linux distribution that uses Python 2.4 as
the default Python, run ``python2.5`` when invoking Python as per the
directions below.


Install Python packages
=======================

Run the following in a terminal to install the required Python
packages and compiler tools::

    $ sudo aptitude install build-essential python2.5 python2.5-dev

If you do not have administrator privileges, request to have them
installed (or the equivalents on the operating system you are using).


Download workingenv and set up an environment for Schevo
========================================================

1. Download `workingenv.py
   <http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/workingenv/workingenv.py>`__
   to your home directory.

2. If it doesn't exist, create a directory named ``env`` in your home
   directory using a terminal or your favorite file manager.

3. In a terminal, create the environment::

    $ python ~/workingenv.py ~/env/schevo


Activate the Schevo environment
===============================

In a terminal, run these commands to activate the Schevo environment
and change to its source directory::

    $ source ~/env/schevo/bin/activate

You'll see ``(schevo)`` added to your prompt.  Repeat this section
every time you want to access the ``schevo`` working environment.
